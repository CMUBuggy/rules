\chapter{Entry Requirements and Procedures}

\section{Race Competition Classes}
	
	There shall be two classes of race competition. These classes shall be known as
	the men's races and as the women's races. Entries in the men's races will be
	distinguished by having only men as pushers, and entries in the women's races
	will be distinguished by having only women as pushers. The drivers of the
	buggies in either of the two classes of competition, may be men or women.

\section{Race Entry Requirements}

\subsection{Entry}

	An entry shall consist of one buggy, one team, and one alternate team. No
	pusher may compete on more than one entry on any single day of competition. No
	driver may compete on more than one entry in each class of race competition
	(one men's race and one women's race) on any single day of competition. No
	buggy may be used by more than one entry in each class of race competition (one
	men's race and one women's race) on any single day of competition. All
	alternate teams are also bound by these conditions.

	Each organization must submit to the Sweepstakes Chairman, or anyone designated
	by that Chairman, a list for each of its entries. The list must include the
	entry's buggy, all of the members of the entry's team, and all of the members of
	the entry's alternate team. All entry lists must be submitted by noon on
	the day before the preliminary races are scheduled to be held. In entering
	members, Sweepstakes will abide by the \htmladdnormallink{CMU Statement of
	Assurance}{http://www.cmu.edu/policies/documents/SoA.html}.

\subsection{Team}

	Each team shall consist of one driver and five pushers. Each member of a team
	must be a currently enrolled, Activities Fee paying, full-time student of
	Carnegie Mellon University and must be a member of the organization entering
	the buggy. In the case of Greek organizations, members are limited to pledges
	and initiated members of that chapter and must be, or have been, listed on an
	IFC membership roster or Panhellenic roster in the case of a sorority. The
	driver for any team may be any eligible student.

	Fraternities may have female push teams. These women do not need to be on the
	IFC roster of said fraternity. Sororities may have male push teams. These men
	do not need to be on the Panhellenic roster of said sorority.

	Last semester seniors shall be considered to be full-time students(regardless
	of credits carried) and must pay the Activities Fee for the semester in which
	they participate in buggy. Any graduate student may participate in buggy for
	any organization (Greek or independent) given they are full-time students of
	Carnegie Mellon University and have paid the applicable Activities Fee for
	graduate students. All potential team members of any organization must
	necessarily have been named previously on the general membership roster
	submitted by the organization.

\subsection{Alternate Team}

	Each entry may have one alternate team consisting of five pushers and one
	driver. Each member of an alternate team must comply with all the same
	requirements that an entry's team members must comply with. No person may be a
	member of more than one team and one alternate team in each class of
	competition. A member of an entry's alternate team may substitute for any of
	that entry's team members.

	Any team member who is substituted for may not compete on any other entry's
	team on the same day unless he or she is also acting as a substitute for a
	member of a different team that day. If any team member of an organization is
	substituted for, at least one other team member from that organization must not
	compete that same day. For example, if a ``B'' team member substitutes for an
	``A'' team member, a ``C'' team member may substitute for the ``B'' team member
	even though that person is still competing that same day provided that the
	``A'' team member does not compete that day. In this way several substitutions
	can take place in order to cover an injury to a member of any team, but a
	member of one team can't switch places with a member of another team.

\subsection{Membership Roster}

	Each organization must submit a membership roster to the Sweepstakes Chairman
	or anyone designated by that Chairman. This roster must be submitted at least
	three weeks prior to the date scheduled for the preliminary races. This roster
	must include the names and student identification numbers of all members of
	that organization who may wish to be members of any of that organization's
	teams or alternate teams in the Sweepstakes competition. A person listed on
	this roster does not necessarily need to then participate in Sweepstakes Races.
	This roster cannot be changed after it is submitted.

\subsection{Design Competition}
	
	Each organization entering the race competition must also participate in the
	display portion of the Design Competition.

\section{Number of Entries}

\subsection{Men's Races}

	Each participating organization may have a maximum of four entries in the men's
	races, but no more than one more entry than that organization had during the
	previous year's races unless they obtain express consent by a majority vote of
	the Buggy Chairmen and approval of the Sweepstakes officials.

\subsection{Women's Races}

	Each participating organization may have a maximum of four entries in the
	women's races, but no more than one more entry than that organization had
	during the previous year's races unless they obtain express consent by a
	majority vote of the Buggy Chairmen and approval of the Sweepstakes officials.

\subsection{Design Competition}

	Each participating organization must display all of its buggies scheduled to
	compete in the Sweepstakes races at the display portion of the Design
	Competition. In addition, each organization may enter a maximum of two buggies
	in the presentation portion of the Design Competition.

\section{Fees}

	Checks submitted for the payment of fees should be made payable to Carnegie
	Mellon University. Payments may also be made by a funds transfer from an
	organization's campus account into the Sweepstakes account.

\subsection{Race Entry Fees}

	Race entry fees must be paid to the Sweepstakes Advisor, or anyone designated
	by the Sweepstakes Advisor, at least one day before the day that heats are
	selected for the preliminary races unless otherwise specified by the Sweepstakes Advisor 
	or the Sweepstakes Chairman.
