\section{Yearly Revisions}

This appendix is meant to hold changes to the Bylaws that should be revisited and revised annually. These are meant to be temporary changes, or those that require tuning and rapid iteration. 

\subsection*{All Gender Division} \label{All Gender}

\subsection*{Greek Rosters}

\subsection*{Highmark Center Construction} \label{Seeding Area}
Each organization participating in the Sweepstakes races shall be permitted to select an area near the starting line of the buggy course, in which they may prepare their buggies prior to the races. These areas may be occupied by trucks or any other non-permanent enclosures. While truck space is limited by the development of the Highmark Center for Health, Wellness, and Athletics (HCHWA), the picking order will first be determined by the number of buggies an organization is planning to race that year, with the picking order then determined by their seeding order for preliminary races. The selection of these areas should be made at least four weeks prior to the date scheduled for the preliminary races. The selection process shall be supervised by the Sweepstakes Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman. The Sweepstakes chairman will assign spaces to organizations at least 2 weeks prior to the date schedule for the preliminary races. No organization may use or attempt to use any area that has been selected by another organization on any day of Sweepstakes racing.

\subsection*{Initial Equipment Retirement Dates}
If a team is able to supply proof of purchase for their safety gear, that date will be used to calculate the 5 year retirement date. Otherwise that piece of equipment will be tagged to retire after Raceday 2024
