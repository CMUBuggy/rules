\chapter{Common Raceday/Freeroll Rules and Procedures}
\label{ch:CommonRules}

\section{General Procedures and Rules}
	Freeroll events shall be known as the combination of freeroll practices (sec. \ref{sec:FreerollRules} pg. \pageref{sec:FreerollRules}), and Sweepstakes races (sec. \ref{ch:RaceRules} pg. \pageref{ch:RaceRules}). Push Practices (sec. \ref{sec:PushPRules} pg. \pageref{sec:PushPRules}) shall be governed by the following only where specifically mentioned, including in sections \ref{ssec:SafetyBuggyDriver} and \ref{ssec:CleanUp}. Freeroll events shall always be governed by the following:

\subsection{Sweepers}
\label{subsec:Sweepers}

	Organizations may be assigned to sweep portions of the course for each freeroll event to help clean debris from the buggy course. These sweepers must be provided even if that organization is not participating in that freeroll event. Each organization shall equip their sweepers with brooms (preferably large push type brooms) and/or shovels.

	Organizations are responsible for ensuring that they have sufficient sweepers and start at an appropriate time such that the course is clear of debris in time for the freeroll event. However, some sweepers and brooms should be available during the entire freeroll event in case they are needed to clean up debris after an accident or some similar incident. The Sweepstakes Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman, may determine when and where the sweepers must report for duty and when they can leave.

	Any organization that fails to complete their sweeping responsibilities at a time deemed appropriate by the Sweepstakes Chairman (usually 30 minutes to the start of the event) shall be fined the amount of \$15.00 for freeroll practice or \$30.00 on Raceday. Any organization failing to provide at least one properly equipped sweeper for a freeroll practice shall be further penalized at the discretion of the Sweepstakes Chairman.

\subsection{Barricaders}
\label{subsec:Barricaders}

	Organizations may be assigned one or more barricades for each freeroll event to help control vehicular traffic on the buggy course. These barricaders must be available from a time that is specified by the Sweepstakes Chairman, until the events are finished for that day. Each organization shall equip their barricaders with reflective vests and they must have an easily accessible line of communication to the Sweepstakes Chairman, which must be used while they are acting as barricaders. All vests must be approved by the Safety Chairman or anyone designated by that Chairman. The Sweepstakes Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman, shall determine when and where the barricaders must report for duty.

	Any organization that fails to provide the required number of properly equipped barricaders for any freeroll event shall be fined the amount of \$20.00 for each missing or improperly equipped barricader. Teams may be further penalized for barricaders who fall asleep or leave their barricade without a replacement with a fine of no more than \$30. 
	
\subsection{Signal Flaggers}
\label{subsec:Flaggers}

	Each organization participating in freeroll events must ensure that at least two signal flaggers are provided for their buggy drivers.

	The first of these required signal flaggers shall be known as chute flaggers. Chute flaggers should provide a signal to the buggy drivers so that the drivers know when to start the right hand turn from Schenley Drive onto Frew Street. Chute flaggers should usually be positioned on the southern curb of Schenley Drive, just east of the intersection of Frew Street.

	The second of these required signal flaggers shall be known as transition flaggers. Transition flaggers should provide a signal to the buggy drivers so that the drivers know when to transition from the right side of Schenley Drive to the left, before the monument. Transition flaggers should usually be positioned on the southern curb of Schenley Drive, somewhere in the vicinity of the crosswalk and Phipps main entrance.

	Flaggers are not permitted to be on the street portion of Schenley Drive while any buggy is freerolling in that area unless they receive specific approval from the Safety Chairman. In general, if flaggers need to position their flags more than an arm's length away from the curb, their signal flags should be attached to extension poles so that they may hold these flags out over the street while still standing on the curb.

	Every signal flagger must have a YELLOW stop flag with a large, black X across the entirety of its face so they may signal to their buggy drivers that there is a hazard ahead. This will be accomplished by waving the YELLOW flag so that the buggy driver can see it. Upon seeing this signal the driver must begin slowing down and come to a stop in a controlled manner. NO organization may use a yellow colored flag for any purpose other than to indicate a problem ahead.

	People providing course communications (usually the Carnegie Mellon University Radio Club) may also signal buggy drivers that there is a problem farther ahead. This will be accomplished by using a YELLOW flag in the same manner explained above.

	If a driver fails to stop within a reasonable distance when a stop flag is shown to the driver, that driver's sponsoring organization shall be fined the amount of \$90.00.

	Each organization's flaggers must have adequate experience relative to flagging. Each signal flagger should talk to the drivers that he or she will be flagging for, in order to determine where those drivers would like the flag to be placed. If possible each flagger should walk the buggy course with those drivers before the freeroll event starts each day that they will be flagging. If a flagger is considered to be acting in an unsafe or inexperienced manner, the Safety Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman, may require that flagger to be replaced with another more experienced flagger.

	If an organization fails to ensure a chute or transition flagger is present for any of its rolls, that organization shall be fined the amount of \$10.00 for practices and \$25.00 on raceday each time one of its buggies attempts to pass a flagging location that does not have a flagger present and flagging for that buggy.

	Each organization participating in freeroll events may also provide additional signal flaggers for its drivers, in order to provide them with additional information about the buggy course or about the race that they are competing in, such as where the other buggies in that heat are at that time. These flaggers may be located anywhere around the buggy course, such as just after Hill 2. These flaggers are also not permitted to stand anywhere on the course whenever any buggy is freerolling, unless they receive specific approval from the Safety Chairman.
	
\subsection{Barricades}
\label{subsec:Barricades}

	Portable barricades shall be placed at several locations near the buggy course while freeroll events are in progress, to stop and/or redirect vehicular traffic when this traffic tries to approach the area of the buggy course. Warning signs which indicate that the road ahead is, or may be, closed, and that there will be barricaders ahead to stop and/or redirect traffic shall be placed near these barricades also. The barricades shall be put in place no later than one hour before races are scheduled to start on each day of Sweepstakes racing, or 30 minutes before the scheduled start of freeroll practice. They shall be removed within 15 minutes of either the end or the cancellation of the freeroll event for that day. The Safety Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman, shall determine if enough barricades are in place in order to have a Sweepstakes race. In order to provide the maximum amount of protection to the Sweepstakes race participants, barricades should be placed at least at the following locations:

	\begin{itemize}

		\item Margaret Morrison Street, at its intersection with Tech Street.

		\item Frew Street on the eastern side of its intersection with Tech Street.

		\item Schenley Drive, just east of its intersection with Tech Street.

		\item Circuit Road at its intersection with Schenley Drive, near the George Westinghouse Memorial Pond.

		\item Panther Hollow Road at its intersection with Schenley Drive, near the northern end of the Panther Hollow Bridge.

		\item Schenley Drive at the eastern end of the Schenley Bridge, near its intersection with Frew Street. The placement of the barricades at this location should be performed carefully. Some space should be left on the northern side of the bridge so that if a buggy failed to make the turn onto Frew Street it would have adequate room to drive across the bridge in the right-hand lane.

		\item Scaife Hall driveway at its intersection with Frew Street.

	\end{itemize}

	At the discretion of the Sweepstakes Chairman, the responsibility of obtaining, storing, and placing barricades in position for freeroll events may be delegated to one organization. The organization charged with this responsibility may not have to provide sweepers, barricaders, or course marshals for each day of Sweepstakes racing, at the discretion of the Sweepstakes Chairman. If the organization responsible for the barricades fails to provide them or remove them for any freeroll event, that organization shall be fined the amount of \$25 for freeroll practice or \$50.00 on Raceday.

	
\subsection{Warning Signs}
\label{subsec:WarnSigns}

	Warning signs shall be placed at several locations near the buggy course while freeroll events are in progress, to warn vehicular traffic when this traffic tries to approach the area of the buggy course. The signs shall indicate that the road ahead is, or may be, closed, and that there will be barricaders ahead to stop and/or redirect traffic. The signs shall be put in place no later than 1 hour before the freeroll event is scheduled to begin. They shall be removed within 15 minutes after the freeroll event has ended. The Safety Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman, shall determine if enough warning signs are in place in order to have a freeroll event. In order to provide the maximum amount of protection to the freeroll event participants, warning signs should be placed at all of the locations where barricades have been placed, plus the following locations:

	\begin{itemize}
		\item Margaret Morrison Street at its intersection with Forbes Avenue.
		\item Schenley Drive at its intersection with Forbes Avenue, near the clubhouse for the Schenley Park Golf Course.
		\item Circuit Road at its intersection with Serpentine Drive.
		\item Panther Hollow Road at the southern end of Panther Hollow Bridge.
		\item Schenley Drive between the Mary E. Schenley Memorial Fountain and the southwest corner of the Carnegie Museum building.
		\item the driveway to the rear of Hamburg Hall at its intersection with Forbes Avenue.
	\end{itemize}

	An organization may be assigned the responsibility of obtaining, storing, and placing warning signs in position for freeroll events may be delegated to one organization (usually the organization in charge of barricades). If the organization responsible for the warning signs fails to provide them or remove them, that organization shall be fined the amount of \$25.00 for any freeroll practice or \$50.00 on Raceday. 
	
	
\subsection{Hay Bales}
\label{subsec:Haybales}

	Approximately 300 fall and an additional 300 spring hay bales should be obtained for use during freeroll events, with two layers lining both sides of the chute. Bales of hay, as opposed to bales of straw, are usually used because they tend to hold up better and therefore can be used more times before they start to fall apart. Freeroll events shall only be held when an adequate number of hay bales are in place around the buggy course. The Safety Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman, shall determine how many hay bales are required in order to have a freeroll event, and where around the buggy course those hay bales shall be placed, in order to provide the maximum amount of protection to the freeroll event participants. Additional haybale requirements for Sweepstakes races shall be determined by The Safety Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman, and ensure two layers line both sides of the chute.

	Organizations may be assigned the responsibility of obtaining, storing, and placing hay bales in position for freeroll events. The hay bales shall be put in place no later than one hour before the freeroll event is scheduled to start, and they should be in place before the sweepers clean that part of the course. They shall be removed within 30 minutes after the freeroll event has ended. If the organization responsible for the hay bales fails to provide them or remove them that organization shall be fined the amount of \$25.00 for practice sessions and \$50.00 on Raceday.
	
	
\subsection{No-Parking Signs}
\label{subsec:NoParking}

	Before each scheduled freeroll event, No-Parking signs shall be placed around the buggy course in order to prevent cars and other motor vehicles from parking there. The signs shall be obtained from the Police Department of the City of Pittsburgh, with the assistance of the Sweepstakes Advisor, if necessary. The signs shall be put in place around the buggy course a minimum of 24 hours before the beginning of the earliest no parking time denoted on the signs. They shall be removed from the course a maximum of 24 hours after the end of latest no-parking time denoted on the signs. If a freeroll event is canceled after the signs have been put up, the signs should be removed from the course before the no-parking time associated with that canceled freeroll event begins.

	Organizations may be assigned the responsibility of obtaining, storing, and placing No-Parking signs in position for freeroll events may be delegated to one organization. If the organization responsible for the No-Parking signs fails to provide them or remove them that organization shall be fined the amount of \$25.00 for any freeroll practice, and \$50.00 on Raceday

	
\subsection{Course Inspection and Official Notification}

	Approximately two and one half hours before the scheduled start of each freeroll practice and 30 minutes before the start of the first race on Raceday, the Sweepstakes Chairman, the Assistant Chairman, the Safety Chairman, and/or anyone designated by any of these Chairmen, shall inspect the buggy course (if necessary) and decide if a freeroll event can be held that day. After a decision has been made, the Carnegie Mellon University Campus Police Department, and the Police Department of the City of Pittsburgh shall be notified of that decision. If no RACES are to be held, representatives of all participating organizations and any other people involved with the running of the races shall be notified by the person or persons who made the decision.


\subsection{Course Communications}

	Freeroll events shall only be held when adequate radio communication equipment is available to provide voice communications around the buggy course for automobile traffic control, buggy traffic control, and emergency situation assistance. Radio communication equipment, and the personnel to operate it, are usually available through the Carnegie Mellon University Radio Club. Any personnel helping to provide radio communications should not be responsible for making decisions concerning what happens during a freeroll event, but instead should be providing information to the Sweepstakes Chairman and his or her assistants, in order that they may make any necessary decisions.
	
	
\subsection{Traffic Control}

	Control of vehicular traffic on the buggy course during each freeroll event will be handled by the City of Pittsburgh police officers, usually from the Park Police Department, who are hired by the Sweepstakes Committee and Carnegie Mellon University to provide police protection during all freeroll events. These officers, with the assistance of the barricaders provided by the buggy racing organizations, will stop vehicular traffic from entering the buggy course while buggies are freerolling.

	If possible, the buggy course will be completely closed to vehicular traffic from the time that each freeroll event begins, until that event has ended for that day. If necessary, the officers will open the buggy course to traffic one or more times during the course of the freeroll event to relieve traffic buildup on the streets around the buggy course. In this event, adequate notice must be given to the Sweepstakes Chairman so that no buggies are permitted to freeroll while there is vehicular traffic on the buggy course. If the course is opened at any time during the event, all of the vehicles entering the course should be instructed not to park on the course. The freeroll event will be continued when the Sweepstakes Chairman has determined that the course is once again closed and that it is clear of all vehicles.
	
\subsection{Permits}

	Practices Sessions and Raceday shall only be held with the approval of the City of Pittsburgh and the Department of Parks and Recreation. This approval shall be in the form of permits to use the public streets on campus and in Schenley Park, issued by both the City of Pittsburgh and the Department of Parks and Recreation.

	Applications for these permits should be made by the Sweepstakes Advisor, in cooperation with the Sweepstakes Chairman, at least six to eight weeks prior to the first scheduled Practice Session in the fall, covering all dates in both the fall and the spring.
	
\subsection{Police}

	Freeroll events shall only be held with the protection and cooperation of both the Police Department of the City of Pittsburgh, and the Carnegie Mellon University Campus Police Department.

	Off-duty City of Pittsburgh police officers, usually from the Park Police Department, are hired by the Sweepstakes Committee and Carnegie Mellon University to provide police protection during all of the freeroll events. Arrangements to have these officers present during the events should be made by the Sweepstakes Chairman, in cooperation with the Sweepstakes Advisor, at the same time that the permits to use the streets are applied for.

	Usually a minimum of four officers are needed to provide protection during the events. They should be available during the entire time that the events are underway, and should report to the Sweepstakes Chairman or the Sweepstakes Advisor on each day of events, at least 30 minutes before the events are scheduled to begin that day. These officers should be stationed as follows:

	\begin{itemize}

		\item One on Schenley Drive near the clubhouse for the Schenley Park Golf Course.

		\item One on Circuit Road at its intersection with Schenley Drive, near the George Westinghouse Memorial Pond.

		\item One on Panther Hollow Road at its intersection with Schenley Drive, near the north end of the Panther
		Hollow Bridge.	

		\item One on Schenley Drive at the eastern end of the Schenley Bridge, near its intersection with Frew Street. (This officer might alternatively be stationed at the western end of the Schenley Bridge.)

	\end{itemize}

	Carnegie Mellon University Campus Police should be available during the entire time that the events are underway in the event that their assistance is needed. Arrangements to have these officers present during the events should be made by the Sweepstakes Chairman, in cooperation with the Sweepstakes Advisor.	
	
\subsection{Safety of Buggies with Drivers}
\label{ssec:SafetyBuggyDriver}
	No buggy that has a driver in it may be left unattended at ANY time. When any buggy is outdoors with a driver in it and it is not being used in a freeroll event, push practice, or a brake test, (i.e. it is not being pushed by a pusher, is not rolling down the buggy course during a freeroll event, or is not rolling freely during a braking capability or drop brake test), someone MUST be within three feet of the buggy (preferably holding the pushbar), watching and attending it so that preventative action can be taken in the event that the buggy starts to move.
	
\subsection{Clean-Up}
\label{ssec:CleanUp}
	After each freeroll event or push practice has been completed, all debris on the buggy course and on the sidewalks around the course must be cleaned up and disposed of properly. Special care must be taken to ensure that all debris left by any race participants is removed, such as empty food and beverage containers, duct tape, buggy preparation materials, hay that has fallen off hay bales, No-Parking signs that have been misplaced, etc.
