All recipients of awards will be determined by the rules herein, and independently of the rules of the Spring Carnival Committee.

The entries placing in the top six final standings of the Men's races and top six final standings of the Women's races shall receive awards. The nature of these awards shall be determined by the Sweepstakes Chairman, or anyone designated by that Chairman.
